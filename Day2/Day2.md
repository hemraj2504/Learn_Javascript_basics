**1.) Datatypes:** Data types describe the different types or kinds of data that we're gonna be working with and storing in variables. Also, a data type defines the kind of value that a variable can hold, as well as the operations that can be performed on that value.

For example, the Number data type can be used to represent numeric values, and it allows for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to be performed on those values. In JavaScript, data types are dynamically typed, which means that the type of a variable can change at any time.

**2.) Types of datatype:**

**Primitive datatypes:**

Primitive data types are the most basic data types and include Number, Null, Bigint, Boolean, Symbol, String,Â  and Undefined(NNBBSSU).

These data types are called "primitive" because they represent the simplest and most fundamental values in JavaScript, and they are not objects.

**Non-Primitive data types:** The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non-primitive data types. It is also known as derived data types or reference data types. Moreover, objects in js are non-primitive datatypes.

**3.) Objects:-**

In JavaScript, an object is a data type that can store a collection of related data in a structured way. An object consists of a set of named properties, each of which has a unique name and a value. The value of a property can be any data type, including primitive types like numbers and Booleans, or more complex types like arrays and other objects.

Objects in JavaScript are similar to objects in real life in that they represent a collection of related data and functionality. For example, you might create an object to represent a person, with properties like their name, age, and address. You could then use the object to store and manipulate this data, as well as to define functions (called "methods") that operate on the data.

E.g.:- let person = {

name: "John Doe",

age: 30,

occupation: "Developer"

};

This code creates an object called "person" with three properties: "name", "age", and "occupation". The object is initialized with the values "John Doe" for the name, 30 for the age, and "Developer" for the occupation. This can be thought of as a way of storing data in a structured format, where each property represents a specific piece of information about the person. In this case, the properties represent the person's name, age, and occupation.
